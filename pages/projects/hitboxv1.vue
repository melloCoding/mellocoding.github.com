      This is a project that ive been wanting to take on for a while. Recently
      ive gotten into playing tekken 8 and ive started to to play in some
      tournaments (mainly for fun i'm pretty awful). Thanks to partcipating in
      these tournaments I've come into contact with a new style of controller a
      "Hitbox" controller. So logically I looked into how expencive these
      controllers are. I was shocked to see that these glorified keyboards were
      over $150 usd.
