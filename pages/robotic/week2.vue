        This week was crunch time because we had a competition this weekend
        coming up. So one of the first things that we did this week was to
        remove a segment from a linear slider beceause at the time we had
        thought that if we didnt we would not pass inspection. After we removed
        the segment of the linear slider. We placed the claw onto the slider.
        Our claw design is rather simple it has to wedge shaped 3D printed parts
        tht interfaces with the sample perfectly.
