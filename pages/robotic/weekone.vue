      First Documented Build Log For the Into the Deep Season
    </h1>
    <p class="px-10 text-xl">
      This is the first actually log for our team's season. I'm a bit late to
      this because i've been busy coding the rest of the website. So at the
      momment we have a mostly functional robot. In the robots curent state it
      can drive around and strafe. The robot is also capable of almost hanging
      itself on the low bar of the truss. We have attached a linear slider to
      the robot aswell to hopefully allow us to score once we have a working
      claw.
