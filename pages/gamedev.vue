  <p class="text-center text-xl px-20">
    I have begun to learn game development as it is something that has
    interested me for a long time. I first go interested in game development
    when a video by CodyCantEatThis appeared on my recomened feed on youtube
    this led to me learning about game jams and eventually I tried my own
    attempt at one. The GMTK Game Jam 2023 which had the theme roles reversed. I
    created a game called Abandoneer in which instead of being a emergency
    helecopter pilot who saved people abandoned in the ocean your goal was to
    abandon theme there. They had to get there somehow. I have since lost the
    files for abandoneer and the submission to the Game Jam was missing key
    files to allow it to run on anothers machine this Game Jam only further
    fueled my intrest in game develpment.
